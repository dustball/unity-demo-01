# unity-demo-01

If Unity crashes on import, delete the Temp directory from the project and try again.  It should work on the second time.  I don't know why this happens, there is no Temp directory in the repository.  

Features:

* Steam VR rig
* HTC Vive Teleport (similar to The Lab) with DPAD
* Spawn infinite pinballs with controller triggers
* Sample terrain
* Red teleport pad on highest platform (not working correctly)
